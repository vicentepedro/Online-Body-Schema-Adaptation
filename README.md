# Online Body Schema Adaptation & Markerless eye-hand kinematic calibration

We propose a markerless hand pose estimation software for the iCub humanoid robot. 
The agent can calibrate its eye-hand kinematic chain without any markers which, from a developmental psychology perspective, can be seen as a body schema adaptation.

## Repository Organization:
The code is divided into three logical components: i) the hand pose estimation, ii) the Robotâ€™s Internal Model generator, and iii) the likelihood assessment, which are implemented, respectively, at the following repository locations:
- modules/handPoseEstimation:
   - include/handPoseEstimationModule.h
   - src/handPoseEstimationMain.cpp
   - src/handPoseEstimationModule.cpp
- modules/internalmodel:
   - icub-internalmodel-rightA-cam-Lisbon.exe
   - icub-internalmodel-leftA-cam-Lisbon.exe
- modules/likelihodAssessment:
   - src/Cuda_Gl.cu
   - src/likelihood.cpp

The software architecture implementing the proposed eye-hand calibration solution can be seen in the following picture:

## Results and Dataset

The following figures show the projection of the fingertips on the left camera during simulated robot experiments. The <font color="blue"> blue </font> dot represents the end-effector projection ( *i.e.*, base of the middle finger), the  <font color="red">red </font> represents the index fingertip, the <font color="gree"> green </font> the thumb fingertip, the <font color="gold"> dark yellow </font> the middle fingertip and the <font color="Khaki"> light yellow </font>the ring and little fingertips.
The first image (a) is the canonical projection (*i.e.*, with all angular offsets equal to zero) and on the second image (b) with the estimated offsets from the proposed method.
